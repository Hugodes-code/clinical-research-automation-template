## Overview

This guide will help you set up an automated clinical research management system using Google's free tools. The system will:

- ‚úÖ Automatically send questionnaires to participants
- ‚úÖ Track who has completed their questionnaires
- ‚úÖ Send reminders to non-responders
- ‚úÖ Generate progress reports
- ‚úÖ Manage multiple intervention types/study arms

**Time Required**: 1-2 hours for initial setup
**Technical Skill Required**: None! Just follow the steps carefully.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:

1. **A Google Account** (free)
   - If you don't have one, create it at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)

2. **Google Forms** for your questionnaires
   - One form for participant enrollment
   - One form for each follow-up period (baseline, 3-month, 12-month)

3. **Basic Information About Your Study**
   - Study name
   - Types of interventions/procedures
   - Follow-up schedule
   - Email templates

---

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Create Your Master Spreadsheet

1. **Open Google Sheets**
   - Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Click the "+" button to create a new spreadsheet

2. **Name Your Spreadsheet**
   - Click "Untitled spreadsheet" at the top
   - Name it: "[Your Study Name] - Master Database"
   - Example: "Heart Surgery Study - Master Database"

3. **Set Up the Enrollment Form**
   - In Google Sheets, go to `Tools ‚Üí Create a new form`
   - This creates a linked form for participant enrollment

4. **Configure the Enrollment Form**
   
   Your enrollment form MUST include these fields (exact names matter!):
   
   - **Email Address** (Google Forms adds this automatically)
   - **Intervention Type** (Dropdown with your study options)
     - Example options: "Surgery A", "Surgery B", "Control Group"
   - **Intervention Date** (Date field)
   - Any other demographic data you need

5. **Save the Spreadsheet ID**
   - Look at your browser's address bar
   - Find the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`
   - Example: In `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123def456/edit`
   - The ID is: `1ABC123def456`
   - **Save this ID - you'll need it later!**

### Step 2: Create Follow-up Questionnaire Forms

For each follow-up period (baseline, 3-month, 12-month):

1. **Create a New Form**
   - Go to [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com)
   - Click "+" to create a new form
   - Name it clearly: "[Study Name] - [Period] Questionnaire"
   - Example: "Heart Surgery Study - Baseline Questionnaire"

2. **Add Your Questions**
   - Email address (required - Forms adds this automatically)
   - Your clinical questions
   - Make sure to include the intervention type if needed

3. **Create Response Spreadsheet**
   - In the form, click "Responses" tab
   - Click the green sheets icon
   - Choose "Create a new spreadsheet"
   - Name it: "[Study Name] - [Period] Responses"

4. **Get the Response Spreadsheet ID**
   - Open the newly created response spreadsheet
   - Copy the ID from the URL (same method as Step 1.5)
   - **Save this ID!**

5. **Get the Form URL**
   - In the form, click "Send" button
   - Click the link icon üîó
   - Copy the form URL
   - **Save this URL!**

Repeat for each follow-up period you need.

### Step 3: Install the Automation Script

1. **Open Script Editor**
   - Go back to your Master Spreadsheet
   - Click `Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script`
   - This opens the script editor

2. **Clear Default Code**
   - Delete any existing code in the editor
   - The editor should be completely empty

3. **Copy the Template Code**
   - Copy the ENTIRE template code from the provided file
   - Paste it into the script editor

4. **Save the Script**
   - Click the üíæ save icon
   - Name your project: "[Your Study Name] Automation"
   - Click "OK"

### Step 4: Configure the Script

Now comes the most important part - customizing the script for your study:

#### 4.1 Basic Study Information

Find this section in the code:
```javascript
const STUDY_CONFIG = {
  studyName: "My Clinical Research Study",
  studyAbbreviation: "MCRS",
  organizationName: "Research Institute",
  primaryEmail: "study-coordinator@example.com",
  senderEmail: "noreply-study@example.com",
  senderName: "Clinical Research Team"
};
```

Replace with your information:
- `studyName`: Your full study name
- `studyAbbreviation`: Short version (3-5 letters)
- `organizationName`: Your hospital/institution
- `primaryEmail`: Your email address
- `senderEmail`: Email that sends automated messages
- `senderName`: Name shown in emails

#### 4.2 Spreadsheet Configuration

Find this section:
```javascript
const SPREADSHEET_CONFIG = {
  mainSpreadsheetId: "YOUR_MAIN_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE",
  formResponsesSheetName: "Form Responses 1"
};
```

Replace:
- `mainSpreadsheetId`: The ID you saved from Step 1.5
- `formResponsesSheetName`: Usually "Form Responses 1" (check your sheet tabs)

#### 4.3 Intervention Configuration

This is where you define your study arms. Find this section:
```javascript
const STUDY_INTERVENTIONS = {
  "Intervention Type A": {
    baseline: {
      emailSubject: "Pre-intervention Questionnaire: Intervention Type A",
      emailBody: `...`,
      responseSpreadsheetId: "YOUR_BASELINE_SPREADSHEET_ID",
      responseSheetName: "Baseline"
    },
    ...
  }
};
```

For EACH intervention type:

1. Replace `"Intervention Type A"` with your actual intervention name
   - This MUST match exactly what's in your dropdown menu!

2. For each follow-up period (baseline, threeMonth, twelveMonth):
   - Update `emailSubject`: Subject line for the email
   - Update `emailBody`: 
     - Customize the message
     - Replace `YOUR_FORM_URL_HERE` with the actual form URL
   - Update `responseSpreadsheetId`: The ID from Step 2.4
   - Update `responseSheetName`: Usually the first tab name

3. Add more intervention types by copying the entire block and modifying

#### 4.4 Follow-up Schedule

Find this section:
```javascript
const FOLLOWUP_SCHEDULE = {
  threeMonthDays: 90,
  twelveMonthDays: 365,
  reminderDelayDays: 7,
  maxReminders: 2
};
```

Adjust for your study:
- `threeMonthDays`: Days until first follow-up (90 = 3 months)
- `twelveMonthDays`: Days until second follow-up (365 = 1 year)
- `reminderDelayDays`: Days before sending reminders
- `maxReminders`: How many reminders to send

#### 4.5 Column Names

Find this section:
```javascript
const COLUMN_NAMES = {
  email: "Email Address",
  interventionType: "Intervention Type",
  interventionDate: "Intervention Date",
  ...
};
```

These MUST match your form field names exactly! Check:
- Spelling
- Capitalization  
- Spaces

### Step 5: Initial Setup and Testing

1. **Run the Setup Function**
   - In the script editor, find the dropdown menu (usually says "myFunction")
   - Select `setupStudy`
   - Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Google will ask for permissions
   - Click "Review permissions"
   - Choose your Google account
   - Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to [Your Project]"
   - Click "Allow"

3. **Check the Logs**
   - Click "View" ‚Üí "Logs"
   - You should see "‚úì Study setup complete!"
   - If you see errors, check your configuration

4. **Run Configuration Test**
   - Select `testConfiguration` from the dropdown
   - Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run
   - Check logs for any issues

5. **Set Up Form Trigger**
   - In your Master Spreadsheet
   - Go to `Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script`
   - Click the clock icon ‚è∞ (Triggers)
   - Click "+ Add Trigger"
   - Choose:
     - Function: `onFormSubmit`
     - Event source: "From spreadsheet"
     - Event type: "On form submit"
   - Click "Save"

## Configuration Guide

### Email Customization

To customize email messages:

1. Find the intervention configuration section
2. Locate the `emailBody` for each period
3. Edit the text between the backticks (`)
4. Keep the form URL format: `[Link text](URL)`

Example:
```javascript
emailBody: `Dear Participant,

We hope you're doing well after your procedure.

Please complete our follow-up questionnaire:
üëâ [Click here to complete](https://forms.gle/your-form-id)

Your responses help improve patient care.

Best regards,
Dr. Smith's Research Team`
```

### Adding New Intervention Types

To add a new study arm:

1. Copy an existing intervention block
2. Paste it after the last intervention
3. Update the intervention name
4. Update all email templates and form IDs
5. Don't forget the comma between interventions!

### Modifying Follow-up Schedule

Common modifications:

- **Monthly follow-ups**: Set days to 30, 60, 90, etc.
- **Weekly follow-ups**: Set days to 7, 14, 21, etc.
- **Single follow-up**: Delete the twelveMonth sections
